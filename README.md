Hello everyone!

This is a very simple Chat GPT powered AI chat bot. You will need to add your own API_KEY location under client. Has a place holder in it for you to replace.

I am using the gpt-3.5-turbo AI model for this one, but you can easily change it in the code under MODEL

I made this as a tool to help me track my progress with my life. Wanted philosophers view point on it, so I picked my favorite.

You can also easily change him out for another, just chat the name / discription in SYSTEM MESSAGES in the first string

there is a clear history function for anytime you want to start fresh, a message will appear on the bottum of the GRADIO UI

Hope you enjoy, and feel free to send me anything to help better the code or experiance.

This bot has been very helpful to me, even though it is simple and can tend to give the same quote once or twice. But still I hope it helps you as it has helped me

Thank you!
